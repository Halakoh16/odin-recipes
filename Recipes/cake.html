    <h1>Chocolate cake</h1>
    
    <img src="/home/d/the_odin_project/odin-recipes/Cake.jpg" alt=picture>

    <p>  have been searching for a great chocolate cake recipe for years. I have found it. My search has ended. I now have THE recipe. If you have ever seen the movie Matilda you will surely remember the scene where the boy is forced to eat the most delicious looking chocolate cake ever. I feel just like that boy when I eat this cake. It is my Matilda chocolate cake for sure. </p>
    <p>This cake is moist and has the perfect crumb. I cannot imagine making a chocolate cake using any other recipe. It is so easy to make and puts doctored cake mix recipes to shame. I’m eating a piece of the cake as I’m writing this, drooling all over my keyboard. It is insanely delicious. A decades search was worth the wait. Every…decadent…bite. Who wants cake?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup of plain yogurt per egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder whisked together per egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mashed banana per egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetended applesuace per egg</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
            <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li> 
            <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
